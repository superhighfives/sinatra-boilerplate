[Heroku](http://heroku.com/) will help you set up a key, which makes deployment much quicker, meaning you don't have to enter your password every time you deploy. Win.\r\n\r\n    # If you haven't set up keys, Heroku will help you out. For example:\r\n    # Could not find an existing public key.\r\n    > Would you like to generate one? [Yn]\r\n    # Generating new SSH public key.\r\n    # Uploading ssh public key /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nIf you get a **publickey error (access denied)** when you try and push the site to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), add your public key manually.\r\n\r\n    # If for some reason this doesn't occur, you can add them manually\r\n    > heroku keys:add\r\n\r\nNext up, we set up the app and deploy it.\r\n\r\n## Deploy the app\r\n\r\nSet up your [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) stack and deploy the app to it.\r\n\r\n    > heroku create\r\n    # Creating temp... done, stack is cedar\r\n    # http://temp.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:temp.git\r\n    # Git remote heroku added\r\n\r\n    # Deploy the app\r\n    > git push heroku master\r\n\r\n    # Celebrate!\r\n    > heroku open\r\n\r\nJoy!\r\n\r\n## Name it something fancy!\r\n\r\nYou can rename the app from the randomly generated http://random-subdomain.heroku.com/ to something more meaningful using:\r\n\r\n    # Rename your subdomain\r\n    > heroku rename newname\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nThis can be more awesome. I am sure of it. [Fork it](http://github.com/superhighfives/sinatra-boilerplate) and get involved.","name":"Sinatra Boilerplate"}
