{"body":"Sinatra Boilerplate\r\n===================\r\n\r\nA standard Sinatra boilerplate, with Compass and Sass.\r\n\r\nThis is a [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) ready [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) app put together by [Charlie Gleason](http://charliegleason.com/) (with help from [John Barton](http://github.com/joho)).\r\n\r\n## Getting things up and running\r\n\r\nTo get the boilerplate running, grab a copy locally.\r\n\r\nNavigate to the directory you downloaded Sinatra Boilerplate, and run the following:\r\n\r\n    # Install the appropriate Ruby gems (shorthand for bundle install)\r\n    > bundle\r\n\r\n    # Start the server\r\n    > foreman start\r\n\r\nThe app will now be accessible at [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000)\r\n\r\n## Getting it onto Heroku\r\n\r\nTo deploy to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), first up, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](http://toolbelt.heroku.com/).\r\n\r\nThis will give you access to the following tools:\r\n\r\n- [Heroku](http://github.com/heroku/heroku) (for Heroku on the command line)\r\n- [Git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer) (for version control)\r\n- [Foreman](http://github.com/ddollar/foreman) (for running Sinatra locally)\r\n\r\n## Sign up for Heroku and login\r\n\r\nOnce you have an account for [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) run the following in your terminal.\r\n\r\n    # Once you've installed the Heroku toolbelt, log in\r\n    > heroku login\r\n\r\nThis will ask for your [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) credentials.\r\n\r\n    # Enter your Heroku credentials.\r\n    > Email: adam@example.com\r\n    > Password: ********\r\n\r\nIf you already have an SSH key set up on your local machine, you'll likely see the following. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) will help you set up a key, which makes deployment much quicker, meaning you don't have to enter your password every time you deploy. Win.\r\n\r\n    # If you haven't set up keys, Heroku will help you out. For example:\r\n    # Could not find an existing public key.\r\n    > Would you like to generate one? [Yn]\r\n    # Generating new SSH public key.\r\n    # Uploading ssh public key /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nIf you get a **publickey error (access denied)** when you try and push the site to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), add your public key manually.\r\n\r\n    # Add your public key to Heroku manually\r\n    > heroku keys:add\r\n\r\nNext up, we set up the app and deploy it.\r\n\r\n## Deploy the app\r\n\r\nSet up your [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) stack and deploy the app to it.\r\n\r\n    > heroku create\r\n    # Creating temp... done, stack is cedar\r\n    # http://temp.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:temp.git\r\n    # Git remote heroku added\r\n\r\n    # Deploy the app\r\n    > git push heroku master\r\n\r\n    # Celebrate!\r\n    > heroku open\r\n\r\nJoy!\r\n\r\n## Name it something fancy!\r\n\r\nYou can rename the app from the randomly generated http://random-subdomain.heroku.com/ to something more meaningful using:\r\n\r\n    # Rename your subdomain\r\n    > heroku rename newname\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nThis can be more awesome. I am sure of it. [Fork it](http://github.com/superhighfives/sinatra-boilerplate) and get involved.","note":"Don't delete this file!
