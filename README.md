Sinatra Boilerplate
===================

A standard Sinatra boilerplate, with Compass and Sass.

This is a [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) ready [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) app put together by [Charlie Gleason](http://charliegleason.com/) (with help from [John Barton](http://github.com/joho)).

## Getting things up and running

To get the boilerplate running, grab a copy locally.

Via Terminal / command line, navigate to the directory you downloaded Sinatra Boilerplate, and run the following:

    # Install the appropriate Ruby gems (shorthand for bundle install)
    > bundle

    # Start the server
    > foreman start

The app will now be accessible at [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000)

## Getting it onto Heroku

To deploy to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), first up, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](http://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

This will give you access to the following tools:

- [Heroku](http://github.com/heroku/heroku) (for Heroku on the command line)
- [Git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer) (for version control)
- [Foreman](http://github.com/ddollar/foreman) (for running Sinatra locally)

## Sign up for Heroku and login

Once you have an account for [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) run the following in your terminal.

    # Once you've installed the Heroku toolbelt, log in
    > heroku login

This will ask for your [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) credentials.

    # Enter your Heroku credentials.
    > Email: adam@example.com
    > Password: ********

If you already have an SSH key set up on your local machine, you'll likely see the following. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) will help you set up a key, which makes deployment much quicker, meaning you don't have to enter your password every time you deploy. Win.

    # If you haven't set up keys, Heroku will help you out. For example:
    # Could not find an existing public key.
    > Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
    # Generating new SSH public key.
    # Uploading ssh public key /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you get a **publickey error (access denied)** when you try and push the site to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), add your public key manually.

    # Add your public key to Heroku manually
    > heroku keys:add

Next up, we set up the app and deploy it.

## Deploy the app

Set up your [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) stack and deploy the app to it.

    > heroku create
    # Creating temp... done, stack is cedar
    # http://temp.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:temp.git
    # Git remote heroku added

    # Deploy the app
    > git push heroku master

    # Celebrate!
    > heroku open

Joy!

## Name it something fancy!

You can rename the app from the randomly generated http://random-subdomain.heroku.com/ to something more meaningful using:

    # Rename your subdomain
    > heroku rename newname
